Umesh Patel's Challenge || Started on July 26, 2022
Challenge: AProjectAWeek (A Project A Week)

I have gained theoretical understanding in DA, DS, ML, DL, AI thru online sources. This is my open ended challenge to do a minimum of one project a week using the knowledge that I have gained.

These projects would be,
-- My own projects of data available from Kaggle or other free data sources
-- Projects from YouTube, Jovian, Udemy or other similar sources
-- A course from Coursera, Udemy... the course could be any topic from DA, DS, ML, DL, AI...
-- Case studies
-- Projects on Python development, SQL

My goals:
-- To start a project on every Monday
-- Learn as I go thru project based learning
-- Not to finish a project but to learn as much possible in a week; I may end up with unfinished project
-- To learn the following topics
   * Data Analytics
   * Machine Learning
   * Data Science
   * Deep Learning
   * Artificial Intelligence
   * Python development
   * SQL

I may add more topics in the future.

Over time, I will keep reviewing this document and would make necessary changes based upon my situation at that point in time.
