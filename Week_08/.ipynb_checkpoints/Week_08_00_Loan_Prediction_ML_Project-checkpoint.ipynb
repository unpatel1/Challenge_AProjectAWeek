Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are **Gender, Marital Status, Education, # of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History** and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers."
