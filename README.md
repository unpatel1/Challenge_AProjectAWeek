# Challenge_AProjectAWeek
**`Umesh Patel's Challenge: AProjectAWeek | Started on: July 26, 2022`**

I have gained theoretical understanding of DA, DS, ML, DL, AI thru online resources. This is my open ended challenge to do a minimum of one project a week using the knowledge that I have gained.

*These projects would be,*  
-- My own projects of data available from Kaggle or other free data sources  
-- Projects from YouTube, Jovian, Udemy or other similar sources  
-- A course from Coursera, Udemy... the course could be any topic from DA, DS, ML, DL, AI...  
-- Case studies  
-- Projects on Python development, SQL  

*My goals:*  
-- To start a project on every Monday  
-- Learn as I go thru project based learning  
-- Not to finish a project but to learn as much possible in a week; I may end up with unfinished project  
-- To learn the following topics
   * Data Analytics
   * Machine Learning
   * Data Science
   * Deep Learning
   * Artificial Intelligence
   * Python development
   * SQL

I may add more topics in the future.

Over time, I will keep reviewing this document and would make necessary changes based upon my situation at that point in time.

**UPDATE: 10/31/2022**  
I started this weekly project challenge on 7/26/2022 and ending it today (10/31/2022) after 14 weeks. My situation recently changed and I started having difficulties finding enough amount of time in a week to do considerable amount of work on my weekly projects. That being said, I won't stop here but will continue working on my projects as usual but without time limitations.  

My Week_14 project was on learning Power BI and I will continue learning it. Instead of the next project being Week_15, it will be Project_15 and the next will be Project_16 and so on. That way I will keep my goal of project based learning alive.
